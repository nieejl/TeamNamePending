# Transaction Pending
Made for Nordic Game Jam 2021 with the theme 'Pending'.

MC has arrived to Snailtown for a secret mission but is followed by monsters trying to prevent MC from doing whatever he does.

The shopkeeper in Snailtown counts the coins super slowly (each minute saying: "Transaction Pending"), thus trying to make the traveler mad (she really does enjoy doing so). But MC has enormous patience, and when the monsters attack, he keeps fighting to protect the extremely annoying shopkeeper, no matter how much she tries to piss him off.

At some point, it may even seem that MC has no emotions, as he is ready to do anything to get what he wants (we literally mean anything, even if it takes him to set the whole village on fire).
